<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vertex class represents a 3-dimensional point in space.

An instance is constructed from two vertextes of Vertex.class -
'orig' and 'dest'.
If no 'orig' coordinates are given, the starting point will be put to 0, 0, 0.

Additional functions in the class are:

magnitude(), which returns the vectors length.
normalize(), which normalizes the vector in case it isn't already.
add(Vector $rhs), which returns the sum of the current and given vector.
sub(Vector $rhs), which returns the difference of the current and given vector.
opposite(), which returns the opposite of the current vector.
scalarProduct($k), which multiplies the vector with the given scalar.
dotProduct(Vector $rhs), which calculates the scalar multiplication of the
current and the given vector.
cos(Vector $rhs), which returns the cosinus angle of the current and the
given vector.
crossProduct(Vector $rhs), which returns a new Vector that is the cross
multiplication of the current and a given vector (calculated with the
right hand system).
